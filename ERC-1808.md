## Simple Summary

A Non-homogenous digital asset data sharing standard.

## Abstract

**Multiverse**  

 Each blockchain game can be considered a game universe, and several game universes with similar basic settings can be considered to have a common multiverse.  

**1808**  

 ERC-1808 Standard (hereinafter referred to as "1808 Standard") is a non-homogeneous digital assets data sharing standard that applied to decentralized distributed ledger network. As the perfect way to represent various non-fungible items, non-homogeneous digital assets can cover the field of game items, gears, characters, map data, and even expansion pack in the game industry. This manual also focus on the multiverse system based on 1808 Standard, such as universe traveling, multiverse, and etc.  
   
## Motivation

  Combining the needs of gaming industry, we reviewed a number of existing non-homogeneous digital asset standards and defined ERC1808 to be the one to standardize all non-homogeneous digital assets data sharing.  
  At present, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-998 of Ethereum network are the popular non-homogeneous digital asset standards, which are used in different scenarios and for different needs on the Ethereum network:
  * ERC-721  
    It is an officially accepted non-homogeneous digital asset standard defined by smart contracts in the Ethereum network. It has a customizable data zone, which makes it possible to digitize items or records.  
    Typical applications are: Crypto Kitties, Crypto Celebrities, etc   
  * ERC-1155  
    It is a standard interface proposed by Enjin to define multiple non-homogenous assets in Ethereum's single smart contract, serving mainly the virtual props in blockchain games.   
    Typical application: War of Crypto.  
  * ERC-998  
    It is a combination of non-homologous tokens (CNFT, Composable NFTs) defined in Ethereum's smart contracts proposed by Matt Lockyer.   
    
   Game items are a kind of non-homogeneous digital assets used in blockchain games. The process of items “travelling” across different universes is that of applying and changing of a non-homogeneous digital asset in different games and services under the same multiverse.  
    
   The 1808 Standard makes it possible for on-chain games to design the multiverse/parallel universes. Different game multiverses are also different game universes, which forms the multiverse of on-chain games. The game items in each universe can be freely circulated, and are written with different attributes, skills, etc. in different games. These items do not affect each other. This is what we mentioned as the item design in the "parallel universes".  
    
   Scalable custom data enables game designers to create unique game assets. Non-interfering zone data allows game assets to be given new properties that are an immune while "travelling" the universes and the multiverse, while also making it possible of data linkage between games (such as skill gain/reduction).             
      
## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Smart contracts implementing the ERC-1808 standard MUST implement all of the functions in the ERC1808 interface.

## Rationale

**NFT Identifiers**

Every NFT is identified by a struct of `string` nftName, `uint256` extAttrCount and `bool` state; inside the ERC-1808 smart contract.

**management mechanism**

In order to organize different games under the same world view, we have established a simple management mechanism.

ERC-1808 standardizes a add function `addNFT`; a logic delete function `setNFTState`; some inquiry function `getNFTs`, `getNFTCount`, `getNFT`; and a option function  isEnableNFT. 

**NFT data sharing mechanism**  

The game prop itself is a non-homogeneous digital asset whose characteristic data should remain unchanged. The process of proposing "traversing" the world line is the process of applying and changing a non-homogeneous digital asset in different games, business, and business under the same world view; it will inevitably involve data sharing and data update issues. We share other data by setting additional data for the current game.

ERC1808 standardizes a set of extra data functions `setExtData`, and the gets the extra data function `getExtData` or `getExtDatas`.

## Backwards Compatibility

An implementation contracts must implement the ERC1808 interface.
